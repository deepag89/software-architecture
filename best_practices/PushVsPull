Use Push when:
- Messages are infrequent. Because doing pull in this situation will only cause consumers to keep polling unnecssarily, resulting in higher network/memory usage. (Solution: Use long polling)


Use Pull when:
- Consumers want to control the rate at which data can be consumed. If we use push instead, the producers will control it and consumer may NOT be able to consume it at it's own rate.
- Consumers want to decide whether to fetch messages in batch or not. The producers should leave this descision to consumers.
